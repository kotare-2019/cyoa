    The dank
  </p>

  <p>
    A hideous laughter errupts from the shack, somehow it seems to emanate from around you and even inside you. A
    dark shadow pours from the shacks chimney and the door flys off it's hinges as a figure erupts from the shack.
  </p>

  <p>
    You blink to process what you're seeing. Before you is a stunning woman with long dark hair and yet.. as you
    approach and the shadow falls across her face you see a haggardness and a long crooked nose.
  </p>

  <p>
    She laughs at your confusion with a cackling rasp and beckons you towards her. You cannot seem to control your
    movements as you inch ever forward towards your untimely fate.
